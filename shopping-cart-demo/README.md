# Shopping Cart Demo


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


Simple bare bones shopping cart application with a catalog page show items available to be added for checkout.


## This project was written with React.js and includes the following modules

1) React Router (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
2) Redux (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
3) React Redux (https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)
4) Redux Thunk (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
5) Semantic UI React (https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React)
6) Styled Components (https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)


## The application currently has a fixed product catalog which can be set up to connect to a backend service providing the products in the following format

Product:

1) productId - Identifier for each product, which can also be used as a component's key for uniqueness
2) productName - The name of the product
3) productPrice - Price of the product
4) productImg - The url for the image of the product


## Possible Improvements to the application

1) Product catalog page should allow for navigation to each product's page to choose specifics (e.g. color) before adding to cart
2) Product catalog could allow users to add multiple products instead of current single product type of catalog
3) TBC
